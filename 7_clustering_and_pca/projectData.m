function Z = projectData(X, U, K)
%PROJECTDATA Computes the reduced data representation when projecting only 
%on to the top K eigenvectors
%   Z = projectData(X, U, K) computes the projection of 
%   the normalized inputs X into the reduced dimensional space spanned by
%   the first K columns of U. It returns the projected examples in Z.
%   X is an (m x n) data matrix

% Select the top K u eigenvectors (n x k)
U_reduced = U(:, 1:K);

% Each transformed example is a row in Z (m x k)
Z = X*U_reduced;
