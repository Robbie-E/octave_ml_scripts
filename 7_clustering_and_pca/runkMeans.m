%   plot_progress) runs the K-Means algorithm on data matrix X, where each 
%   row of X is a single example. It uses initial_centroids used as the
%   initial centroids. max_iters specifies the total number of interactions 
%   of K-Means to execute. plot_progress is a true/false flag that 
%   indicates if the function should also plot its progress as the 
%   learning happens. This is set to false by default. runkMeans returns 
%   centroids, a Kxn matrix of the computed centroids and idx, a m x 1 
%   vector of centroid assignments (i.e. each entry in range [1..K])
