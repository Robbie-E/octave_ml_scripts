function W = randInitializeWeights(L_in, L_out)
%RANDINITIALIZEWEIGHTS Randomly initialize the weights of a layer with L_in
%incoming connections and L_out outgoing connections
%   W = RANDINITIALIZEWEIGHTS(L_in, L_out) randomly initializes the weights 
%   of a layer with L_in incoming connections and L_out outgoing 
%   connections. 
%
%   Note that W should be set to a matrix of size(L_out, 1 + L_in) as
%   the first column of W handles the "bias" terms
%

% You need to return the following variables correctly 
W = zeros(L_out, 1 + L_in);

% Note: The first column of W corresponds to the parameters for the bias unit
% Randomly initialize the weights to small values
epsilon_init = sqrt(6)/sqrt(L_in + L_out); %0.12
W = rand(L_out, 1 + L_in)*2*epsilon_init - epsilon_init;
