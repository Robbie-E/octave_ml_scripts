function x = emailFeatures(word_indices)
%EMAILFEATURES takes in a word_indices vector and produces a feature vector
%from the word indices
%   x = EMAILFEATURES(word_indices) takes in a word_indices vector and 
%   produces a feature vector from the word indices. 

% Total number of words in the dictionary
n = 1899;

%               Concretely, if an email has the text:
%
%                  The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
%
%               Then, the word_indices vector for this text might look 
%               like:
%               
%                   60  100   33   44   10     53  60  58   5
%
%               where, we have mapped each word onto a number, for example:
%
%                   the   -- 60
%                   quick -- 100
%                   ...
%
%              (note: the above numbers are just an example and are not the
%               actual mappings).
%
%              construct a binary feature vector that indicates if a
%              word occurs in the email. That is, x(i) = 1 when word i
%              is present in the email. Concretely, if the word 'the' (say,
%              index 60) appears in the email, then x(60) = 1. 

x = zeros(n, 1);
word_indices_dup_removed = unique(word_indices');
x(word_indices_dup_removed) = 1;
endfunction
