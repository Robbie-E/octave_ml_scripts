%MULTIVARIATEGAUSSIAN Computes the probability density function of the
%multivariate gaussian distribution.
%    p = MULTIVARIATEGAUSSIAN(X, mu, Sigma2) Computes the probability 
%    density function of the examples X under the multivariate gaussian 
%    distribution with parameters mu and Sigma2. If Sigma2 is a matrix, it is
%    treated as the covariance matrix. If Sigma2 is a vector, it is treated
%    as the \sigma^2 values of the variances in each dimension (a diagonal
%    covariance matrix)
