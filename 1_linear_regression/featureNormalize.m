function [x_norm, mu, sigma] = featureNormalize(x)
%FEATURENORMALIZE Normalizes the features in X 
%   FEATURENORMALIZE(X) returns a normalized version of X where
%   the mean value of each feature is 0 and the standard deviation
%   is 1. This is often a good preprocessing step to do when
%   working with learning algorithms.
%   X is not the design matrix

%               Note that X is a matrix where each column is a 
%               feature and each row is an example. You need 
%               to perform the normalization separately for 
%               each feature
mu = mean(x,1);
sigma = std(x,1);
x_norm = (x-mu)./sigma;
